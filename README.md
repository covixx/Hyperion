Hyperion started off in mid-September as my first non-trivial project, as a Zig port of Kilo by antirez, and I have been trying to add functionality on top of it ever since. 
Currently Hyperion supports: 
- I/O 
- Directory Navigation 
- Syntax Highlighting (static)
- Search
- A status bar for updates
- LSP integration for diagnostics (Zig only at the moment)

Features planned: 
- Vertical split
- LSP based syntax highlighting
- Compile support
- Terminal integration
- Inline errors
- Modes and keyboard shortcuts
- Multi-language support

Currently Hyperion is on the backburner as I learn more employable technologies, but post December updates and new feature support will resume.
