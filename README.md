Hyperion started off in the beginning of September as a Zig implementation of Kilo by antirez, but I have been trying to add functionality on top of it ever since. Currently Hyperion supports: 
- I/O 
- Directory Navigation 
- Syntax Highlighting (static)
- Search
- A status bar for updates
- LSP integration for diagnostics (Zig only at the moment)

Features planned: 
- Vertical split
- LSP based syntax highlighting
- Compile support
- Terminal integration
- Inline errors
- Modes and keyboard shortcuts
- Multi-language support

Mostly because I'm learning as I go along, new feature support will be slow but constant.
